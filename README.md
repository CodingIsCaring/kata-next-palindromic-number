## Kata Next Palindromic Number

In this kata you will be given a positive integer ("val") and you have to create 
the function nextPal() that will output the smallest palindrome number higher 
than "val".

Let's see:

```
nextPal(11) == 22

nextPal(188) == 191

nextPal(191) == 202

nextPal(2541) == 2552
```

You will be receiving values higher than 10, all valid.
